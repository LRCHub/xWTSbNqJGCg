Once there was a thankless leader|Blinded by a golden ring|Now there's no more peaceful gatherings|Take me 'cross the aisle now baby|Let me see how y'all get down|Take a hopeful sound and make it loud||I said|Turn it up|when I've had enough|I wanna feel the love|Turn it up||Once there was a paradise|Where a boy saw suffering|He raised his voice up loud and began to sing|All the people gathered 'round him|He cried out a freedom song|Everyone began to sing along||He said|Turn it up|cause I've had enough|I wanna feel the love|Turn it up||They said be quiet little girl|But you amplified the sound|Of a million broken hearts from all around|You can hear the children crying|It's not safe to go outside|We're free but we gotta keep our kids alive|Oh y'all! We can't let em down||Turn it up|cause I've had enough|I wanna feel the love|Ah C'mon Turn it up|Turn it up|cause I've had enough|I wanna feel the love|Turn it up|ah yeah, Turn it up|Turn it up Turn it up
