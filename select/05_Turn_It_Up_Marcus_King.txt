You ever hear a song come on that radio
Make you wanna reach over
Grab the dial
Roll it and turn it on up?

You ever sit down in the shade
Put bottleneck of that Tennessee whiskey
Tastes so smooth makes you wanna
Turn it on up?

Driving 90 miles an hour down a dead end street
Cold steel under my feet
Dancing with the devil, bound to be in trouble
Damn it, don't it feel so sweet?
Testing my nerves, taking the curves
Leaning heavy on my luck
And I still, and I still
And I still wanna turn it on up

You ever been out in the Carolina sun
With the one you love
It's so hot feel like it's fixin' to melt ya
But you just wanna grab her close
Pull her on in and turn it on up?

Driving 90 miles an hour down a dead end street
Cold steel under my feet
Dancing with the devil, bound to be in trouble
Damn it, don't it feel so sweet?
Testing my nerves, taking them curves
Leaning heavy on my luck
And I still, and I still
And I still gotta turn it on up

Testing my nerves, taking them curves
Leaning heavy on my luck
But I still, but I still
But I still gotta turn it on up
But I still, but I still
But I still gotta turn it on up
