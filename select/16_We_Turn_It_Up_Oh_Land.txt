We turn it up, we turn it up.
We're coming up, we're coming up.
Out in the streets, I hear the crack of thunder.
People keeping low, people searching for some cover,
But in my room, I hear the sound of trumpets,
Meeting me through the field that keeps us in.
We turn it up, we turn it up
We don't care what you say
We're coming up, we're coming up.
We don't care what you say
We turn it up, we turn it up
We don't care what you say
We're coming up, we're coming up.
We don't care what you say
Message to the world, can you feel the heat is rising?
From the heights of above the storm,
Can you see the lightning flashing?
From where I live, I can hear the voices joining.
Like trumpets, through the field they use to keep us in.
We turn it up, we turn it up
We don't care what you say
We're coming up, we're coming up.
We don't care what you say
We turn it up, we turn it up
We don't care what you say
We're coming up, we're coming up.
We don't care what you say
If you're afraid, fear will only break your heart.
If you're afraid, you know your walls will keep them away.
We turn it up, we turn it up
We don't care what you say
We're coming up, we're coming up.
We don't care what you say
We turn it up, we turn it up
We don't care what you say
We're coming up, we're coming up.
We don't care what you say
We turn it up, we turn it up
We don't care what you say
We're coming up, we're coming up.
We don't care what you say
We turn it up, we turn it up
We don't care what you say
We're coming up, we're coming up.
We don't care what you say
